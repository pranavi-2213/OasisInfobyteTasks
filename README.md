## 🚗TASK 2: Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project was developed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I built a Car Price Prediction Model using Machine Learning techniques. The model predicts car prices based on features like brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and more to help users estimate the market value of vehicles.

📌 Project Overview
🔹 Collected and preprocessed car dataset
🔹 Explored and visualized data for insights
🔹 Built multiple regression models for prediction
🔹 Evaluated model performance using various metrics

🛠️ Technologies Used
✅ Python
✅ Pandas, NumPy
✅ Scikit-Learn
✅ Machine Learning Algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
✅ Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
